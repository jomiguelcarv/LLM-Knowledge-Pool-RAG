Buildner is thrilled to announce the international "Iceland Ski Snow Cabin" design competition. This challenge invites architects and designers to conceive a cozy, eco-friendly ski cabin that complements Iceland's captivating landscape.

The contest seeks pragmatic and sustainable designs that offer a skier's sanctuary equipped with amenities like gear storage and a warm gathering space. This is a chance to craft a landmark that marries functionality with the mystic allure of Icelandic winters.
---
Iceland, a small Nordic island country, is nestled between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. With a population of less than 333,000, it stands as Europe's most sparsely populated nation. Most residents call the capital, Reykjavik, and its surrounding areas home.
---
## Dating back to 874 AD, Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson was the first permanent settler on the island. Over the centuries, more Norwegian settlers and individuals from other Scandinavian countries followed suit. Iceland was under Norwegian and Danish rule from 1262 to 1814 before becoming a republic in 1944. Today, Iceland boasts low taxes while maintaining a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal healthcare and tertiary education for citizens. The country relies heavily on renewable energy, with its primary industries being fishing, agriculture, and tourism.
---
Iceland's cultural heritage, rooted in its Scandinavian ancestry, has evolved to become distinct from other Scandinavian nations due to centuries of isolation. The Icelandic language, for instance, remains closest to Old Norse among all the Scandinavian languages. As descendants of Germanic and Gaelic settlers, Icelanders speak a North Germanic language closely related to Faroese and West Norwegian dialects.

Iceland's literary tradition includes classical works like the Icelanders' sagas—medieval tales set during the nation's age of settlement. The most famous of these sagas include Njáls saga, an epic blood feud story, and Grænlendinga saga and Eiríks saga, which recount the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern Newfoundland).
---
Iceland's striking geography is characterized by its varied and extraordinary landscapes. As a volcanically and geologically active island, Iceland spans 103,000 km2, with 62.7% of it being tundra. Its coastline features numerous fjords, which host the majority of the country's settlements. Iceland's interior, a blend of sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, is inhospitable, and glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands on the island's exterior.

Though situated just outside the Arctic Circle, Iceland enjoys a temperate climate, courtesy of the Gulf Stream. Geographically closer to continental Europe, Iceland is considered part of Europe even though its nearest landmass is Greenland. The island lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a geological formation where oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust, resulting in Iceland's creation through rifting, accretion, and volcanism.
---
The Mývatn region, located in the north of Iceland, boasts some of the country's most breathtaking natural wonders and is considered the Northern Lights Capital of Iceland. The region encompasses Iceland's fourth-largest body of water, Lake Mývatn, which spans 36.5 square kilometers and houses an abundance of natural marvels and diverse wildlife.
---
As part of the Diamond Circle—a popular travel route in northern Iceland—Lake Mývatn and its surrounding area offer visitors an idyllic setting for birdwatching, fishing, relaxing in natural hot springs, and exploring the enchanting lava fortress of Dimmuborgir. Not to mention, the Northern Lights are more frequently sighted in this region of Iceland. Among these astonishing attractions, the Skútustaðagígar craters stand out as a remarkable geological feature.
---
The Krafla Crater, a monumental testament to Iceland's raw geothermal power, stands majestically in the Mývatn region. This seismic marvel is not just a scenic wonder but also an emblem of the island’s vibrant volcanic activity. Krafla’s caldera, the result of centuries of eruptions, spans approximately 10 kilometers and is part of a larger volcanic system that includes a striking lava field and the renowned Víti explosion crater, filled with a strikingly blue geothermal lake.

The presence of this natural feature enhances the area’s allure, offering visitors a window into the Earth's fiery heart. Its landscapes, shaped by both fiery flows and icy formations, create an otherworldly beauty that is unmistakably Icelandic. In the embrace of the Arctic serenity, the crater and its surroundings provide a unique backdrop that is a draw for those seeking to connect with nature's rawest forms.
---
In the colder months, the contrast between the steaming geothermal areas and the snow-covered landscapes around Krafla is stark and stunning. In warmer seasons, the rich hues of the volcanic earth come to life, offering a palette of colors that is both rare and captivating.

As a focal point in the Diamond Circle route, the crater area invites exploration, contemplation, and inspiration, promising visitors an unforgettable encounter with the dynamic forces that continue to shape the mythical land of fire and ice.

## Buildner invites architects and designers around the globe to explore the northern enchantment with our "Iceland Ski Snow Cabin" competition.

The challenge is to blend Iceland's captivating heritage with contemporary design, manifesting in a ski cabin that not only meets the functional demands of winter sports enthusiasts but also embodies the essence of the Mývatn region—a tapestry where folklore and nature intertwine, shadowed by the dramatic Krafla crater.

Designs will be evaluated for their innovation, sensitivity to the Icelandic environment, and their potential to become a natural extension of the local heritage. We expect proposals to go beyond aesthetics and functionality, encapsulating the magic of the Northern Lights and the dramatic Icelandic terrain. The successful project will not just be a model of architectural excellence but a space that tells a story, much like the sagas of old.

## Participants are tasked to conceptualize a ski cabin that will serve as a beacon of warmth and shelter in the stark yet stunning landscape of Iceland.

The structure should honor the rugged beauty of its setting while providing essential amenities like equipment storage, a warm communal area, a self-serving refreshment station, changing facilities, and space for maintenance equipment. Designs should be sensitive to the environment and reflect the ethos of Icelandic simplicity and resilience.

Not only does this competition offer the prestige of winning, but the triumphing design will be considered for actual construction. This represents a unique opportunity to contribute a physical and enduring piece of architecture to Iceland's cultural narrative. We invite you to bring forth a vision that captures the essence of Iceland—a cabin that could be the setting of a modern saga, a place of rest and community that enriches the Mývatn region's legacy as a natural wonderland.

## Design Brief for Skier's Cabin near Krafla Crater, Iceland

Design an inviting and functional skier's cabin that serves as a warm retreat and practical facility for enthusiasts visiting the slopes near Krafla crater, in the Mývatn region of Iceland. The cabin should encapsulate the needs of a skiing community, providing essential amenities and a space that celebrates the spirit of the locale.

The cabin must include fundamental facilities such as toilets, changing rooms, and a self-service refreshment area, enhancing the overall experience for skiers. It should also have a dedicated space for the storage of sporting equipment, such as skiing gates and safety netting, and a garage large enough to accommodate a snow groomer, approximately 12m x 6m in size.

Ensure that the cabin design is accessible and meets international accessibility standards to welcome a diverse group of visitors. The design should be resilient and comfortable, providing shelter and warmth in Iceland’s dynamic climate, known for its cold winters and milder summers.

The design should consider the visual and environmental impact of the building, promoting a seamless integration with the natural surroundings. It should direct visitor flow, optimize views of the landscape, and respect the open vista.

Select materials and construction techniques that emphasize sustainability and minimal environmental disruption. Although the construction budget is to be defined, the proposal should be mindful of cost-effectiveness and potential for future scalability.

Your design should not only serve the immediate practical needs but also act as a draw for both local and international visitors, enhancing the profile of the Mývatn region. It should stand as a symbol of thoughtful architectural intervention that resonates with the identity of the area.

While the above requirements outline the core of the project, you are encouraged to bring innovative and improved strategies to your proposal, ensuring that the final design is both dynamic and sensitive to its unique Icelandic context.

The competition encourages an economical approach to design, with an emphasis on cost-efficiency and practicality. Although the client has not set strict budgetary limits, participants must consider the higher construction costs typical to Iceland, influenced by factors such as the importation of materials, specialized labor, and the demanding environmental conditions that necessitate robust and thermally efficient structures. Prospective designs should target a reasonable cost framework, ideally within the range of 300,000 - 400,000 ISK per square meter.

Entrants are prompted to incorporate local materials, adopt straightforward design techniques, and leverage Iceland's geothermal resources for energy-efficient solutions, thereby optimizing the budget. The competition's objective is to yield a design that is not only financially prudent but also innovative, sustainable, and well-adapted to Iceland's climatic rigors.

With no explicit budgetary constraints from the client, designers have the flexibility to creatively interpret the brief. Yet, they should judiciously balance financial feasibility with architectural innovation, ensuring their proposals are viable for eventual construction in the distinctive landscape of Iceland’s Mývatn region.
---
The competition site is a scenic spot just northeast of Lake Mývatn, near the majestic Krafla crater, at the foot of a popular skiing slope (Skíðasvæði Mývetnings í Kröflu). Here, amid Iceland's raw beauty, lies the potential site for your innovative cabin design.

Currently, there's a simple setup for skiers to change and a basic toilet. These are set to be removed, offering a blank slate for the new design. There are no remnants to consider, so you have the freedom to envision the space from the ground up.

Designers are invited to think creatively about sustainable solutions for water and sewage connections. The competition favors proposals that are environmentally considerate and self-sufficient.

You'll be working with a flat landscape, which means you won’t have to navigate tricky terrain. Yet, the openness of the area means your design will be highly visible, an aspect to bear in mind. The site boundaries are flexible—you can choose where to situate your cabin within a suggested zone.
